# Bird-song-learner
This project consists in designing an application that allows its users to practice their bird identification skills using the xeno-canto API: https://www.xeno-canto.org/explore/api.

List of birds from SEO birdlife: https://seo.org/listaavesdeespana/

Catalan bird names from: http://www.rarebirds.cat/catalan-bird-list-ocells-de-catalunya-2020/. Copied the HTML table and converted it to a csv file using https://www.convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm.


TODO:
- Being able to add custom modes (maybe a custom.py file and saving resulting game modes in a directory in pickle format)
- Some trouble with VLC if going through questions fast:
  - [00007f361010a6e0] prefetch stream error: reading while paused (buggy demux?)
